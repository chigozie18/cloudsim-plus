/**
 * An implementation of {@link DatacenterBroker} that uses a best mapping between incoming 
 * cloudlets and VMs. The policy first tries to map an incoming cloudlet to the first free VM (will go in order) 
 * in data center 1/2. A VM is considered free, if it has no work (no executing or waiting cloudlets). 
 * If thereâ€™re no free VMs found in data center 1/2, it maps the cloudlet to a free VM in data center 3. 
 * If neither data center 1/2 or data center 3 have a free VM, it maps the cloudlet to the VM with the 
 * least remaining work, which is in datacenter 1/2 or 3.
